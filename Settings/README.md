# Elderry's Personal Configurations
I maintain this project to keep my personal configurations easily being tracked. Including PowerShell, WSL Bash etc. I mainly use this on my Windows 10 machine. Support for macOS is being considered.
## Use
In PowerShell, require administrator privilege.
```
config.ps1 [target]
```
If no target is provided, all scripts, including `ps1` and `sh`, will be executed.
## Customize
This project is easy to customize, you can add PowerShell or Bash script in `Configuration` directory, and that's
it.
## Contact
Any problem, feel free to contact `Elderry@outlook.com`.
